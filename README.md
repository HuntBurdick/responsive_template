This is a responsive boilerplate template based off of the HTML5 Boilerplate repo.

The template requires a LESS compiler to utilize the full features. To configure the template visit /stylesheets/config.less. Here you set the base parameters for your template.

The responsive template is meant as a starting point and so is kept as simple as possible beyond the configuration options.

I will be incorporating this as the base template for my other open source project, CMS_Admin, very soon.
